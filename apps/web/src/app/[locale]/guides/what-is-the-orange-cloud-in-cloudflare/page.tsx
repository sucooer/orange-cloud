const FAQ: Array<{ q: string; a: string }> = [
	{
		q: "What does the orange cloud mean in Cloudflare?",
		a: "It means that DNS record is proxied. Cloudflare answers queries for the hostname with its own anycast IP addresses, so HTTP and HTTPS requests reach Cloudflare first and your Cloudflare settings — caching, WAF, rules — apply before the request is passed to your origin server.",
	},
	{
		q: "What’s the difference between the orange cloud and the grey cloud?",
		a: "It is the proxied vs DNS only choice. The orange cloud proxies traffic through Cloudflare; the grey cloud — spelled gray in Cloudflare’s own documentation, and labelled DNS only in the dashboard — does not. DNS only means the record returns your origin IP address, so visitors connect straight to your server, and no caching, WAF, or HTTP analytics apply to those requests.",
	},
	{
		q: "Should the orange cloud be on or off?",
		a: "On for any A, AAAA, or CNAME record that serves your website or API over HTTP/HTTPS. Off for mail hostnames, domain-verification records, SSH and other non-HTTP services, and endpoints a third party has to reach at your real IP address.",
	},
	{
		q: "What does DNS only mean in Cloudflare?",
		a: "DNS only — the grey cloud — means Cloudflare publishes the record but does not proxy it. The query returns your origin IP address, visitors connect straight to your server, and caching, the WAF, Rules and Workers routes never see the request. MX, TXT, NS, SRV and every record type other than A, AAAA and CNAME is permanently DNS only.",
	},
	{
		q: "Does the orange cloud hide my origin IP?",
		a: "For that hostname, yes — queries return Cloudflare anycast addresses instead of your server’s address. It does not help if another record in the same zone, such as a mail, FTP, or legacy subdomain record, still publishes the same origin IP.",

						<strong>The orange cloud means a DNS record is proxied:</strong> Cloudflare answers with its

					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					In the Cloudflare dashboard, every A, AAAA, and CNAME record has a small cloud icon next to it.
					Orange means <em>proxied</em>. Gray — spelled grey in much of the world, and often searched that
					way — means <em>DNS only</em>. So the meaning of the orange cloud comes down to one question about
					that record: <strong>proxied vs DNS only</strong>. It looks like a cosmetic toggle and it
					is not: it decides whether Cloudflare is a CDN and firewall in front of your site, or merely the
					place where your DNS records happen to live.

				<h2 id="orange-vs-gray">Orange cloud vs grey cloud: proxied vs DNS only</h2>

				<p>
					One consequence is worth spelling out: a grey-clouded record publishes your server’s real
					address, which is what makes “I moved to Cloudflare and still got hit directly” possible.
				</p>

				<h2 id="which-records">Which records can be orange-clouded</h2>
				<p>
					Only <strong>A</strong>, <strong>AAAA</strong>, and <strong>CNAME</strong> records — the ones
					that resolve a name to an address. MX, TXT, NS, SRV, CAA and the rest are always DNS only, and
					the dashboard offers no toggle for them: proxying works by handing out Cloudflare anycast
					addresses instead of yours, and there is nothing to substitute in a TXT or MX record.
				</p>
				<p>Three behaviours that surprise people:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Mixed records on the same name are treated as proxied.</strong> If one A record for{" "}
						<code>www</code> is orange and another is gray, Cloudflare proxies both.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Proxying is inherited along a CNAME chain.</strong> If a name anywhere in the chain is
						proxied, the request is proxied — and a proxied CNAME is always{" "}
						<Link href="/guides/cloudflare-cname-flattening">flattened</Link>, because the answer it
						returns is a Cloudflare address rather than the target name.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Some CNAME targets are blocked from proxying on purpose.</strong> DKIM and validation
						targets — <code>dkim.amazonses.com</code> and its subdomains, subdomains of{" "}
						<code>acm-validations.aws</code> and <code>onmicrosoft.com</code>, <code>zmverify.zoho.com</code>{" "}
						— cannot be orange-clouded, because a proxied answer would break the very check they exist
						for.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Pointing a proxied record at a hostname in a <em>different</em> Cloudflare account is refused —
					that is{" "}
					<a
						href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/support/troubleshooting/http-status-codes/cloudflare-1xxx-errors/error-1014/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						Error 1014, CNAME Cross-User Banned
					</a>
					, unless the owner of the target has onboarded your hostname through Cloudflare for SaaS. That
					sanctioned version is{" "}
					<Link href="/guides/cloudflare-orange-to-orange">Orange-to-Orange routing</Link>.
				</p>

				<h2 id="ports">The proxy only covers certain HTTP and HTTPS ports</h2>
				<p>
					The orange cloud is an HTTP/HTTPS reverse proxy, not a general network tunnel. By default it
					handles these ports:
				</p>
				<div className="table-wrap">
					<table>
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th scope="col">Protocol</th>
								<th scope="col">Ports proxied by default</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th scope="row">HTTP</th>
								<td>
									<code>80</code>, <code>8080</code>, <code>8880</code>, <code>2052</code>,{" "}
									<code>2082</code>, <code>2086</code>, <code>2095</code>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th scope="row">HTTPS</th>
								<td>
									<code>443</code>, <code>2053</code>, <code>2083</code>, <code>2087</code>,{" "}
									<code>2096</code>, <code>8443</code>
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
				<p>
					Everything outside that list — SSH on 22, RDP on 3389, SMTP on 25, a database port, a game
					server — is not proxied. The hostname now resolves to Cloudflare, which has no reason to
					forward those ports to your machine, so the connection simply fails. Grey-cloud that hostname,
					or put it behind{" "}
					<a
						href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						Cloudflare Spectrum
					</a>
					, which proxies non-HTTP ports — all TCP and UDP ports on the Enterprise plan.
				</p>
				<p>
					The alternate ports (everything above except <code>80</code> and <code>443</code>) are proxied
					but <em>not cached</em> by default. If you serve a site on 8443 and wonder why the cache hit
					rate is zero, that is why.
				</p>

				<h2 id="when-gray">When DNS only (the grey cloud) is the right answer</h2>
				<p>Reach for DNS only whenever the far end is not plain HTTP/HTTPS to your own origin:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Mail.</strong> MX records cannot be proxied at all, and a hostname used for mail
						delivery (<code>mail.example.com</code>) should stay grey. Cloudflare does not proxy SMTP on
						port 25, so proxying it points senders at Cloudflare and delivery stops.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Domain verification.</strong> Verification CNAMEs and TXT records must return the
						exact value the third party expects; a proxied answer returns Cloudflare addresses instead
						and verification fails.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Non-HTTP services.</strong> SSH, RDP, FTP, game servers — anything on a port outside
						the list above.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Sites hosted on a SaaS platform</strong> that terminates its own TLS — Wix,
						Squarespace, Webflow — unless the platform is explicitly integrated with Cloudflare. Two
						proxies both terminating TLS and both redirecting to HTTPS is how you get certificate
						errors and redirect loops.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Endpoints validated by IP.</strong> If a partner allowlists your server’s address,
						proxying replaces it with Cloudflare’s.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					A rule of thumb: <em>if the hostname serves web traffic on a standard port and you control the
					origin, orange-cloud it. Everything else stays grey.</em>
				</p>

				<h2 id="troubleshooting">When the toggle causes an error</h2>
				<p>Most orange-cloud incidents look like one of these.</p>
				<h3>SSH or a custom port stopped working right after you switched</h3>
				<p>
					Expected. That port is not proxied. Move the service to its own hostname and grey-cloud that
					hostname, keeping the web hostname orange.
				</p>
				<h3>Mail stopped being delivered</h3>
				<p>
					Check whether the hostname your MX record points to is proxied, and give mail its own DNS-only
					hostname. (Cloudflare does try to save you: if an MX record points at a proxied name, it
					prepends <code>_dc-mx</code> to the answer so mail bypasses the proxy — a safety net, not a
					design to rely on.)
				</p>
				<h3>522, 521, or 524 errors appeared</h3>
				<p>
					These exist only because traffic is now proxied: Cloudflare is reaching your origin and not
					getting a usable answer. 521 means the origin refused the connection and 522 means it timed
					out — usually a firewall that does not allow{" "}
					<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
						Cloudflare’s IP ranges
					</a>
					. 524 means the origin accepted the connection but exceeded the proxy read timeout.
				</p>
				<h3>Redirect loop or certificate error appeared</h3>
				<p>
					Usually the{" "}
					<a
						href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						SSL/TLS encryption mode
					</a>
					: with <strong>Flexible</strong>, Cloudflare talks to your origin over plain HTTP, and an origin
					that redirects HTTP to HTTPS will{" "}
					<a
						href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/troubleshooting/too-many-redirects/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						loop forever
					</a>
					. Use <strong>Full (strict)</strong> with a valid certificate on the origin — the differences
					between the modes, and which error each one produces, are in{" "}
					<Link href="/guides/cloudflare-ssl-tls-encryption-modes">
						the guide to Cloudflare’s encryption modes
					</Link>
					.
				</p>
				<h3>Your origin IP leaked anyway</h3>
				<p>
					Look for other records in the same zone — <code>mail</code>, <code>ftp</code>,{" "}
					<code>cpanel</code>, a forgotten staging subdomain — still pointing at the same server. And
					while a newly added domain is pending activation (up to 24 hours), records behave as DNS only
					even when marked proxied; rotate the origin IP after activation to close that window.
				</p>
				<h3>Client certificates (mTLS) stopped validating</h3>
				<p>
					On a proxied record TLS terminates at Cloudflare, which opens a second connection to your
					origin — so the origin never sees the visitor’s client certificate. Validate client
					certificates{" "}
					<a
						href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/client-certificates/"
						target="_blank"
						rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>
						at Cloudflare
					</a>{" "}
					instead, or have Cloudflare forward the certificate details to your origin in a header.
				</p>
				<h3>Windows authentication prompts in a loop</h3>
				<p>
					Integrated Windows Authentication, NTLM and Kerberos are incompatible with proxied records:
					NTLM authenticates the TCP connection rather than the request, and Cloudflare does not
					guarantee that consecutive requests reuse the same connection. That hostname needs to be DNS
					only.
				</p>
				<h3>Your app now sees Cloudflare addresses as the visitor IP</h3>
				<p>
					Expected: the origin’s peer is Cloudflare. Read the real client address from the{" "}
					<code>CF-Connecting-IP</code> header (or <code>X-Forwarded-For</code>) instead of the socket.
				</p>

				<h2 id="how-to-switch">How to turn the orange cloud on or off</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>In the dashboard:</strong> open your domain, go to <strong>DNS → Records</strong>,{" "}
					<strong>Edit</strong> the record, and click the cloud under <strong>Proxy status</strong>. It
					takes effect immediately, though resolvers may hold the previous answer for up to five
					minutes.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Over the API:</strong> proxy status is the <code>proxied</code> boolean on the record:
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code>{API_EXAMPLE}</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					<strong>From your phone:</strong> that toggle is the reason this site exists —{" "}
					<Link href="/">Orange Cloud</Link> is a native iOS and Android client for Cloudflare, and flipping
					proxy status is one tap in the DNS list.
				</p>

				<h2 id="both-orange">What if both ends are orange?</h2>
				<p>
					If your proxied record points at a hostname that is itself proxied — typically a SaaS platform
					using Cloudflare for SaaS, such as a Shopify store on your own domain — the request crosses two
					Cloudflare zones and both sets of settings apply, in order. Cloudflare calls this
					Orange-to-Orange, or O2O:{" "}
